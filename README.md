Encodes images to latent vectors and takes cosine similarity to previous training data to determine class. Has probably been done before.

~85% accuracy on the Omniglot dataset ( the mnist of one-shot learning ) and ~89% accuracy on Adience DB's dataset of face images. Both of these were done with 5 classes per episode.
